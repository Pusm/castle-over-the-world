Most remarkably, they claimed to have encountered Marie Antoinette herself, sitting and sketching near the Petit Trianon. This incident, documented in their 1911 book 'An Adventure,' remains one of the most famous alleged paranormal experiences in history.",
      "Marie Antoinette's Ghostly Return: The spirit of Marie Antoinette is said to haunt the palace grounds, particularly around the Petit Trianon where she spent her happiest hours. Visitors have reported seeing a woman in 18th-century dress walking through the gardens at twilight, often appearing sad and forlorn. Local guides tell of cold spots, unexplained sounds of harpsichord music, and the scent of roses appearing suddenly in areas associated with the doomed queen.",
      "The Phantom Court: On certain moonlit nights, witnesses claim to see ghostly figures in court dress walking through the Hall of Mirrors, reenacting the elaborate ceremonies that once took place there.

    "culturalSignificance": "Hohenzollern Castle stands as the embodiment of German Romanticism and the symbol of Prussian dynastic power that shaped modern Europe. As the ancestral seat of the House of Hohenzollern, which produced Prussian kings and German emperors, this castle represents the intersection of medieval heritage with 19th-century nationalist idealism. The current structure, rebuilt in the spirit of German Romantic medievalism, reflects the era's longing for a heroic past and unified German identity.",
    "legends": [
      "Princess Hohenzollern's Eternal Vigil: The castle is haunted by a tragic princess of the Hohenzollern line who died of a broken heart while awaiting her lover's return from the Crusades. Her spirit, dressed in white medieval robes, is seen walking the ramparts at midnight, holding a lantern and searching the horizon. Local folklore claims she will not rest until the Hohenzollern dynasty is fully restored to power.",
      "The Iron Chancellor's Shadow: Otto von Bismarck's spirit is said to haunt the castle's council chambers, where he once advised the Kaiser. Visitors report seeing a tall figure in military uniform poring over maps and documents, as if still planning the unification of Germany. The ghost appears most frequently during times of German political crisis.",
      "The Founding Ravens: According to medieval legend, the first Hohenzollern count chose this mountain because he followed three ravens that led him to hidden treasure buried by ancient Germanic tribes. The ravens are said to still nest in the castle's highest tower, and their departure would signal the end of the Hohenzollern line."
