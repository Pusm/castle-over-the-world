                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">Leonardo's Last Masterpiece: Legend claims that the château's famous double-helix staircase was Leonardo da Vinci's final architectural design, created during his residence at nearby Clos Lucé. The master allegedly drew the plans on his deathbed in 1519, the same year construction began. Local folklore suggests that da Vinci's spirit influenced the builders, ensuring the staircase would function as intended despite its seemingly impossible engineering.</p><p class="legend-item">The Salamander's Promise: Francis I's heraldic salamander, carved over 300 times throughout the castle, is said to come alive during the full moon. According to legend, the salamanders emerge from the stone to patrol the castle, protecting it from fire and evil spirits. The salamander was believed to live in fire without being consumed, symbolizing Francis I's determination to survive political and military challenges.</p><p class="legend-item">The Ghost of the Hunting King: Francis I's spirit is said to haunt the castle's towers, appearing in hunting attire on misty mornings. Witnesses report seeing a regal figure on horseback riding through the walls, eternally pursuing the hunt that consumed so much of his life at Chambord. The sound of hunting horns echoing from empty rooms has been reported by countless visitors.</p>
