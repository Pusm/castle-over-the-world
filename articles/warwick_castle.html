                <p>Built by William the Conqueror in 1068, Warwick Castle exemplifies the evolution from Norman military fortress to stately home. Known as the 'Kingmaker's Castle' after Richard Neville, it represents the pinnacle of medieval English fortress evolution and has been central to English politics for nearly a millennium.</p>

                <h2>Detailed History & Significance</h2>
                <p>Warwick Castle stands as one of England's most significant medieval fortresses, strategically positioned on a cliff overlooking the River Avon. Originally built as a wooden motte-and-bailey fortress by William the Conqueror in 1068, it evolved into a formidable stone castle under successive earls. The castle served as the seat of the Earls of Warwick, most notably Richard Neville, the 'Kingmaker,' whose political manipulations during the Wars of the Roses gave him the power to 'make and unmake kings.' Five great families—the Beaumonts, Beauchamps, Nevilles, Dudleys, and Grevilles—shaped the castle over nine centuries, transforming it from Norman stronghold to palatial residence while maintaining its defensive capabilities.</p>

Legend connects this creature to the ancient Earls of Warwick, serving as a supernatural guardian that appears during times of danger.
