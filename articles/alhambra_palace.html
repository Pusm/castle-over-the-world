                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>The Alhambra stands as the crown jewel of Islamic civilization in Western Europe, representing the sophisticated fusion of art, architecture, poetry, and philosophy that characterized Al-Andalus. As the last Muslim stronghold in Iberia, it embodies both the pinnacle of Nasrid achievement and the poignant end of eight centuries of Islamic rule in Spain. Its preservation through Christian reconquest and modern restoration makes it a unique window into medieval Islamic culture.</p>

                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">The Enchanted Moor: Boabdil, the last Nasrid sultan, is said to haunt the palace, eternally lamenting the loss of his kingdom. On certain nights, visitors report seeing a figure in royal robes walking through the Court of Lions, weeping for the paradise lost. Local legend says his tears nourish the orange trees in the gardens, keeping them eternally fragrant as a reminder of Muslim Spain's former glory.</p><p class="legend-item">The Fountain of Lions' Secret: The twelve marble lions supporting the fountain in the Court of Lions are said to contain the souls of Nasrid warriors, transformed by magic to guard the palace's greatest treasures. At midnight during the full moon, the lions allegedly come to life for one hour, roaming the palace to protect it from harm. Hidden beneath the fountain is rumored to be a chamber containing the lost library of Córdoba.</p><p class="legend-item">The Nazarí Rose Garden: In the Generalife gardens grows a unique strain of roses that bloom only at night, their white petals glowing like moonlight. Legend tells that these were planted by Zoraida, a Nasrid princess, each rose representing a love letter to her Christian knight lover. When the roses bloom, it's said you can still hear their whispered love songs in Arabic carried on the evening breeze.</p>
