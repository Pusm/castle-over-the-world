                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>As the world's largest ancient castle complex and continuous seat of power for over 1,100 years, Prague Castle embodies the heart of Czech national identity. From Bohemian princes to Holy Roman Emperors to modern presidents, it has witnessed the entire span of Central European history, serving as a bridge between East and West, Catholic and Protestant, medieval and modern.</p>

                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">Princess Libuše's Prophecy: According to Czech mythology, Princess Libuše stood atop the castle hill and prophesied the foundation of Prague, declaring 'I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars.' This founding legend connects the castle directly to Prague's mythical origins and establishes it as the prophetic heart of the Czech nation. Libuše's spirit is said to watch over the castle, appearing during times of national crisis to guide Czech leaders.</p><p class="legend-item">The Eternal Fire: Deep beneath the castle lies a natural cavern where eternal fire burns, according to ancient Bohemian legend. This mystical flame is said to represent the undying spirit of the Czech people, burning brightest during times of foreign occupation and dimming only when the nation is truly free. Alchemists and mystics have sought this fire for centuries, believing it holds the secret to immortality.</p><p class="legend-item">Golden Lane Alchemists: The tiny houses of Golden Lane were said to house Rudolf II's court alchemists, who sought to transmute base metals into gold and discover the philosopher's stone. Local folklore tells of successful experiments, with golden light emanating from workshop windows at midnight, and of secret tunnels connecting the lane to the emperor's private chambers where Rudolf conducted his own mystical experiments.</p>
