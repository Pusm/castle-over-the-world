                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">The Phantom Ship of Stone: Local legend tells that the Alcázar was built in the shape of a ship's bow because it houses the ghost of a Moorish admiral who died defending the castle. On foggy nights, the entire castle is said to appear as a massive stone ship sailing through the mists, with the admiral's spirit at the helm, eternally searching for a way to return to his beloved Al-Andalus.</p><p class="legend-item">Alfonso X the Wise's Supernatural Studies: King Alfonso X, known as 'El Sabio' (The Wise), conducted astronomical and alchemical studies in the castle's tower. Legend claims he made a pact with djinn (Islamic spirits) to gain knowledge of the stars and planets. His ghost is said to still roam the castle at night, continuing his scholarly pursuits in the afterlife, with books and scrolls materializing around his spectral figure.</p><p class="legend-item">The Queen's Tragic Secret: Isabella I of Castile allegedly sealed a chamber in the castle containing evidence of a dark family secret. This hidden room is said to open only during lunar eclipses, revealing treasures and documents that would change Spanish history. Visitors report cold drafts and whispered voices in Old Castilian emanating from sealed walls.</p>
