                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>The Palace of Versailles stands as the ultimate symbol of absolute monarchy and French royal power, serving as the political and cultural heart of Europe for over a century. As the seat of the French court from 1682 until the French Revolution in 1789, it embodies the intersection of artistic achievement, political ambition, and revolutionary upheaval that shaped modern European history. The palace represents the zenith of French Baroque architecture and the template for royal residences across Europe.</p>

                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">The Moberly-Jourdain Time Slip: On August 10, 1901, two English academics, Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain, claimed to have experienced a time slip while walking through the gardens of Versailles. They reported seeing the palace and gardens as they appeared in the 18th century, complete with people in period dress. Most remarkably, they claimed to have encountered Marie Antoinette herself, sitting and sketching near the Petit Trianon. This incident, documented in their 1911 book 'An Adventure,' remains one of the most famous alleged paranormal experiences in history.</p><p class="legend-item">Marie Antoinette's Ghostly Return: The spirit of Marie Antoinette is said to haunt the palace grounds, particularly around the Petit Trianon where she spent her happiest hours. Visitors have reported seeing a woman in 18th-century dress walking through the gardens at twilight, often appearing sad and forlorn. Local guides tell of cold spots, unexplained sounds of harpsichord music, and the scent of roses appearing suddenly in areas associated with the doomed queen.</p><p class="legend-item">The Phantom Court: On certain moonlit nights, witnesses claim to see ghostly figures in court dress walking through the Hall of Mirrors, reenacting the elaborate ceremonies that once took place there. The phantom courtiers appear to be attending an eternal ball, dancing to music that cannot be heard but only felt as a vibration in the air.</p>
