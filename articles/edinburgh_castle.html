                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Perched dramatically on Castle Rock, Edinburgh Castle has dominated Scotland's capital for nearly two millennia. This ancient fortress guards the Scottish Crown Jewels and embodies the turbulent history of Scotland, serving as both royal residence and military stronghold throughout the centuries.</p>
