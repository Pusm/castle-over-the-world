                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>Himeji Castle, known as the 'White Heron Castle' (Shirasagi-jō), represents the pinnacle of Japanese castle architecture and samurai culture. As Japan's finest surviving example of prototypical castle design, it embodies the sophisticated military engineering and aesthetic principles that defined the country's feudal period. The castle's survival through wars, earthquakes, and modernization makes it a unique window into medieval Japanese civilization.</p>

                    <h3>Legends & Folklore</h3>
                    <p class="legend-item">The Legend of Okiku and the Nine Plates: The most famous ghost story of Himeji Castle tells of Okiku, a beautiful servant girl who worked for the cruel samurai Aoyama Tessan. When Okiku refused his romantic advances, Tessan hid one of ten valuable plates and accused her of theft. As punishment, she was tortured and thrown into a well. Every night, her spirit emerged from the well to count the plates: 'Ichi-mai, ni-mai, san-mai...' (One plate, two plates, three plates...) reaching nine before letting out a bone-chilling wail that could drive listeners to madness.</p><p class="legend-item">The White Heron's Protection: Local legend claims that the castle is protected by the spirit of a divine white heron, which appears during times of great danger. During World War II bombings, residents reported seeing a great white bird flying over the castle, deflecting bombs with its wings. The heron is said to embody the pure spirit of Japanese warriors who died defending the realm.</p><p class="legend-item">The Yōkai Osakabehime: The castle tower is home to Osakabehime, a powerful yōkai (supernatural being) who takes the form of a reclusive woman in elaborate court dress. She commands lesser spirits and can read human minds, appearing only to those pure of heart. Legend says she guards the castle's ancient treasures and will grant wisdom to worthy visitors who approach with sincere respect.</p>
