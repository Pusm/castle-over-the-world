The castle represents the tension between romantic idealism and political reality in 19th-century Germany.",
    "literaryConnections": "The castle walls are decorated with frescoes depicting scenes from Wagner's operas including Tannhäuser, Tristan und Isolde, Lohengrin, and Parsifal. Wagner privately referred to Ludwig as 'Parsifal,' and the king's tragic story inspired countless literary works about mad kings and romantic excess.",
    "folklore": "Local Bavarian folklore tells of the 'Fairy Tale King' who built castles in the clouds. Peasants believed Ludwig was under an enchantment, building impossible dreams that would bankrupt the kingdom. The castle is said to be haunted by Ludwig's restless spirit, still wandering the unfinished halls of his greatest creation.",
    "socialHistory": "Construction employed hundreds of craftsmen and workers, representing the peak of 19th-century craftsmanship. The castle's construction costs of 6.2 million gold marks (€47 million today) strained Bavaria's resources, leading to social tensions between the monarchy and its subjects who bore the tax burden.",
