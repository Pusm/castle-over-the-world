Built as a personal refuge for the reclusive king, it incorporates advanced heating systems, running water on all floors, and even a telephone system - revolutionary for its time. The interior decoration draws heavily from Wagner's operas, particularly Tannh√§user, Lohengrin, and Parsifal, with elaborate murals depicting scenes from Germanic legends.",

The palace served as the principal residence of French kings from 1682 until the French Revolution in 1789, housing up to 20,000 courtiers, servants, and visitors. Its creation required revolutionary landscape engineering, transforming marshland into elaborate terraced gardens, and pioneered new construction techniques that influenced palace design across Europe. The palace became the template for royal residences from Russia's Peterhof to Germany's Sanssouci.",
